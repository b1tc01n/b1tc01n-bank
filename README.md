+ I am 24 years young.

 

+ I've been a gamer all of my life & have been building custom gaming desktops for 10+ years.

 

+ I mainly stream CS;GO & Overwatch via Twitch.

 

+ I trade Cryptocurrencies as a hobby. I started learning about Bitcoin back in 2010 due to Anonymous along with @trutherbot's posts on twitter.

(Trutherbot's new twitter handle is @trutherbotred, go educate yourself)

 

+The main cryptocurrency I hold onto is Bitcoin (BTC). I also have Ripple (XRP) as well.

+ I started off playing CS in 2000, 1.1. (Back when the player model Artic Camo skin was godly).

+ I played CS all the way up until Source released & never became a fan. I never played too competitively.

+ I won my first LAN tounrnament at Rapid Fire in South San Jose around 15 years old.

+ Streaming also has become a big part of my life as it helps me deal with my personal problems such as anger issues & depression. Let alone I've met some cool, talented, smart people whom I've met throughout the CS/CS;GO community & through streaming which some have now become good friends I talk to on the daily.

+ I am very knowledgable about CryptoCurrencies {Ƀitcoin & Altcoins} & have been involved since 2011. My main goal for my stream is to have a Q & A about Ƀitcoin/CryptoCurrencies because the masses are not understanding the true value surrounding the technology of Bitcoin {primarily due to mainstream media spreading false information}. Ƀitcoin is not a stock. Ƀitcoin the technology has never been hacked once. Only 3rd party Ƀitcoin exchange platforms that hold Ƀitcoin on their websites have been hacked. As of right now, the technology behind Ƀitcoin remains bulletproof. How am I so sure? Because Ƀitcoin is a direct threat to the Central Banking Pyramid Scheme that creates FIAT currency with no backing out of thin air & the whole reason Ƀitcoin was spawned was to make Central Banks & The Federal Reserve obsolete. Non existent. Therefore, the govt/NSA/DOJ/etc. is doing everything in their power to keep their corrupt monetary system perpetuating {Central Banks & Fiat Currency backed by nothing} & kill Ƀitcoin, if you will. These Banksters DO NOT ONLY DISLIKE ɃITCOIN BUT CRYPTOCURRENCY IN GENERAL. For the simple fact its messing up their corrupt scheme to control everyone via Fiat-Currency. Which all currency in the world, aside from 3 countries (Iran, North Korea, Cuba) is owned by the Rothschilds Banking Family. Weird, how those 3 remaining countries without Central Banks installed are the countries our mainstream media spreads propaganda about to install fear into our society so we think they are some sort of Anti-American terrorists & we need to deal with them accordingly? No. Money is the root of all evil.

"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank. Give a man a bank and he can rob the world."

+ I also am teaching myself code on codecademy.com. As of right now I know HTML & CSS and am looking for work for web development. I also have proficient skills in photoshop as well.
